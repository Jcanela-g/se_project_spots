## My thoughts

This project was very enjoying and a bit stressful at the same time. I really liked that it was through FIGMA so that it gives that real world feel of how you would get a project.
Form validation and submit button function to switch between active and disabled at the appropriate times was challenging. Putting this together was a great learning opportunity.
